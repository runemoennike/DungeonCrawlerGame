!#!#!#!#Welcome to Divide!!#!#!#
Use the left mouse to navigate, attack, interact and!#
pick up items, and the right mouse button to cast!#
spells (when you learn them from books). !#!#!#
Use the interface buttons to open your inventory,!#
character stats, skills and spells. !#!#!#
The red area represents your hit points, and the!#
blue your spell points.!#!#!#
You can trade items with one of the guys in the !#
sanctuary (this area), and port to previous areas!#
using the other guy.!#!#!#Walk down the stairs to!#
begin your adventure...!#" />

<story name="story_entering_1" text="
As you enter the dungeon, a foul stench of death!#
and rot strikes you... and a hint of dust.!#!#!#
Perhaps some of these barrels contain interesting!#
items that will make it worth your while?!#"/>

<story name="story_entering_2" text="
Well done, you've made it further down the!#
dungeons!!#!#!#
If you've leveled up yet, remember to open up your!#
character sheet (press c or use the button) and !#
place the stat points you've gained. !#!#!#
Do the same thing with skills, by pressing t or !#
use the pretty button."/>

<story name="story_entering_3" text="
Captivated by the epic thrill of looting and!#
character building you venture deeper into the!#
dungeons.!#!#!#
Seems like a good idea. Keep going!#"/>
<story name="story_entering_4" text="
Dungeons, dungeons, dungeons. Yes, they will!#
keep coming at you, for a fair while yet.!#!#!#
Did you meet the blue wizard yet?!#"/>

<story name="story_entering_5" text="
With all traces of light long gone, there is no!#
other way than down.!#!#!#
Well, except for up. But that would be like giving!#
up. And you're not a quitter, right?"/>

<story name="story_entering_6" text="
Whoa! Everything looks different here! !#!#!#
It seems that someone really got tired of painting!#
the walls in the same way over and over.!#"/>

<story name="story_entering_10" text="
Remember back when you were just another nobody!#
in dungeon level 1? !#!#!#
You've sure come a long way since then!"/>

<story name="story_entering_16" text="
What's that on the floor? Sure looks grimey."/>

<story name="story_entering_19" text="
The stench increases ten-fold as your walk down!#
the stairs. You must be getting really close by!#
now..."/>

<story name="story_entering_20" text="
Uh oh!"/>
