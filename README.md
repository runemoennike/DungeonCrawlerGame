# DungeonCrawlerGame

This is a game that I did with [Niels Jeppesen](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/nielsjeppesen) for a course in the spring of 2010. The object of the course was to gain experience in working with larger software projects. From the abstract of the report:

> The purpose of this project has been to gain experience with developing large-scale software projects. We decided to design and implement a game similar to the popular title Diablo from 1997 and its successor Diablo 2 from 2000. The focus has been on artificial intelligence of groups, randomized map generation, loot generation, and character leveling, as well as the general inner workings of a large game. The outcome is a fully functional and complex game implemented in Java, using jMonkeyEngine for the visual representation. We found that as the size of the code base grows, it becomes increasingly important to have a well structured design and implementation - especially when combining as many algorithms and systems into one program as we did with our game.

At the time, this was by far the largest project I had ever worked on (and completed) and it was a great experience. The game is fully playable, although with a bunch of balance issues, and can be downloaded [here](http://moennike.com/sites/default/files/portfolio/divide-r7.zip).
